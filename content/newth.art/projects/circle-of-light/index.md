For World AIDS Day, I had the honor of creating the "Circle of Light" installation in Golden Gate Park. This installation, a fifth broken circle, joined the National AIDS Memorial's four existing ones. Each broken circle symbolizes lives lost to the AIDS epidemic and the enduring impact on our community.

In designing "Circle of Light," I wanted a space for people to gather and honor those weâ€™ve lost. The broken circles poignantly represent the voids left by our loved ones. As the light illuminated the circle, it highlighted our unity and resilience, while the gaps reminded us of those no longer with us. This installation embodied our collective commitment to remembrance and the ongoing fight against HIV/AIDS.
