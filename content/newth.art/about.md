---

As an artist at the intersection of light, technology, and human experience, I create immersive installations that inspire, provoke thought, and illuminate our shared humanity.

## My Artistic Vision

My work explores the transformative power of light and interactivity in public spaces. I believe that art has the ability to create moments of collective wonder, foster community connections, and shine a light on important social issues.

## Notable Projects

- **Illuminating the Pink Triangle**: A beacon of resilience and hope over San Francisco, created in collaboration with [Illuminate.org](https://illuminate.org/?ref=newth.ai) and the [National AIDS Memorial](https://www.aidsmemorial.org/?ref=newth.ai).
- **Circle of Light**: An illuminated installation for World AIDS Day 2021, focusing on remembrance and hope.
- **THEM (2022-2023)**: A 30-foot climbable art installation at Burning Man, conceived by Sim√≥n Malvaez and brought to life through collaboration with Brenden Darby.

## Collaborations and Partnerships

I've had the privilege of working with esteemed organizations and events, including:

- Burning Man
- Electroluxx
- Illuminate.org
- National AIDS Memorial

## My Approach

Each project I undertake is a unique journey, blending cutting-edge technology with artistic vision to create experiences that resonate on a deeply human level. Whether it's a towering sculpture at Burning Man or a city-wide light installation, my goal is always to create art that invites participation, reflection, and connection.

## Let's Create Something Illuminating

I'm always excited to explore new collaborations and push the boundaries of what's possible with light and art. If you have a project in mind or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please don't hesitate to reach out.
