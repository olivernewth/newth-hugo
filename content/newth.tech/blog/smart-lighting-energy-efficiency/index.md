Smart lighting isn't just about convenienceâ€”it's a powerful tool for energy efficiency. Here's how my clients are saving energy and money with intelligent lighting control. {{< citation 1 "Daylight harvesting systems adjust artificial lighting based on natural light levels, optimizing energy use." >}}

## Key Strategies

1. **Daylight Harvesting**
   - Automatic adjustment based on natural light
   - Integration with motorized shades
   - Light level optimization

2. **Occupancy-Based Control**
   - Advanced motion detection
   - Room-specific settings
   - Time-based adjustments

3. **LED Integration**
   - Color temperature management
   - Dimming optimization
   - Fixture selection guidelines
