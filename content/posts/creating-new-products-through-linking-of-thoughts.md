Balancing the technical with the human has always been at the heart of my journey in product management, ensuring every innovation truly serves our needs.

Thinking, particularly in product management, is about linking concepts together. It's about seeing how a user's need can be met with a technical capability, drawing from an API here or an AI model there. This methodical yet creative process forms the cornerstone of product-led growth, ensuring that every innovation aligns with actual human needs and wants.

In retrospect, the arc of my career has always been about finding balance. Balancing the technical and the human, the innovative and the reliable, the lead and the team effort. As AI assistants evolve or as AR/VR reshapes our digital interactions, this balance will remain essential. New technologies will continue to disrupt and enrich our lives, and it's up to us to harness their potential responsibly, ethically, and with a continual focus on the human experience.
