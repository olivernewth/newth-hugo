Digital gardening is a method of cultivating and sharing knowledge online. Unlike traditional
blogging, which often focuses on polished, finished pieces, digital gardening embraces the idea of
"learning in public" and showcasing the growth of ideas over time.

## Key Concepts

1. **Non-linear growth**: Ideas in a digital garden don't follow a chronological order. They evolve
   and interconnect organically.

2. **Work in progress**: Entries in a digital garden are often in various stages of completion, from
   rough notes (seedlings) to well-developed ideas (evergreen).

3. **Interconnectedness**: Digital garden entries often link to each other, creating a web of
   knowledge. For example, this concept is closely related to [[personal-knowledge-management]].

4. **Iterative development**: Garden entries are regularly updated and refined as the gardener's
   understanding grows.

## Tools for Digital Gardening

There are various tools available for creating and maintaining a digital garden:

- Static site generators like Hugo (which we're using)
- Specialized note-taking apps like Obsidian or Roam Research
- Wikis and personal wiki software

## My Digital Gardening Journey

I've decided to transform my blog into a digital garden to better reflect my learning process and to
create a more interconnected body of knowledge. This entry itself is part of that journey, and I
expect it to grow and evolve over time.

As I explore more about [[writing]] and [[learning-in-public]], I'll update this entry and create
new, interconnected pieces of content.
