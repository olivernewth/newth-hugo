title: 'About Oliver'
---

I'm Oliver, an AI Product Leader based in San Francisco. With over a decade of experience at
companies like Meta, Microsoft and most recently Covariant, I've been at the forefront of developing
innovative AI solutions that are reshaping how we interact with technology in our daily lives and in
the physical world.

## Professional Journey

My career has been driven by a passion for leveraging AI to create impactful products. From leading
the development of AI-powered robotics at Covariant to enhancing user experiences at Meta and
expanding language AI capabilities at Microsoft, I've consistently pushed the boundaries of what's
possible with machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Some highlights of my journey include:

- Spearheading AI robotics solutions at Covariant, working on technology that allows robots to learn
  skills much like chatbots do
- Increasing user engagement on Meta platforms by 75% through enhanced AI-driven features
- Expanding Azure Cognitive Services to support 25 languages for enterprise clients

## Beyond the Office

When I'm not immersed in the world of AI, you'll find me actively contributing to my community. I'm
passionate about using technology and art to promote social awareness and inclusivity. Some of my
proudest moments include:

- Collaborating with [Illuminate](https://illuminate.org/?ref=newth.ai) to bring inspiring public
  art projects to life, such as
  [The Pink Triangle](https://illuminate.org/projects/the-pink-triangle/?ref=newth.ai)
- Creating LGBTQ+ themed art installations for events like World AIDS Day and Burning Man
- Participating in the [AIDS Lifecycle](https://www.aidslifecycle.org/?ref=newth.ai), cycling 545
  miles from San Francisco to Los Angeles

## Sharing Knowledge

I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and experiences. That's why I regularly write about
various topics related to AI, product management, and personal growth. You can find my latest
thoughts on:

- Trust & Safety in AI Products
- The Hidden Challenges of Safe AI
- Knowledge Management Tools
- Personal Growth and Development
- Creative Thinking and Idea Generation
