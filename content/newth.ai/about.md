I'm Oliver, an AI Product Leader based in San Francisco. With over a decade of experience at
companies like [Google](https://about.google.com), [Meta](https://about.meta.com), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) and [Covariant](https://covariant.ai) (acquired by Amazon), I've been at the forefront of developing innovative AI
solutions that are reshaping how we interact with technology in our daily lives and in the physical
world.

## Professional Journey

My career has been driven by a passion for leveraging AI to create impactful products. Currently at Google, I'm building platforms that integrate DeepMind models into products and developing cohesive ML infrastructure. Previously, I led enterprise vision AI development at Covariant, enhanced user experiences at Meta, and expanded language AI capabilities at Microsoft. Throughout my journey, I've focused on pushing the boundaries of what's possible with machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Some highlights of my journey include:

- Building GenAI Workflows at [Google](https://about.google.com), focusing on ML infrastructure and AI technology development
- Leading enterprise vision AI solutions at [Covariant](https://covariant.ai) (acquired by Amazon), with technology that achieved 85% accuracy and $100M+ projected revenue
- Increasing user engagement on [Meta](https://about.meta.com) platforms by 75% through enhanced AI-powered features
- Expanding [Azure Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/) to support 25 languages for enterprise clients

passionate about using technology and art to promote social awareness and inclusivity. Some of my
proudest moments include:

- Collaborating with [Illuminate](https://illuminate.org/?ref=newth.ai) to bring inspiring public
  art projects to life, such as
  [The Pink Triangle](https://illuminate.org/projects/the-pink-triangle/?ref=newth.ai)
- Creating LGBTQ+ themed art installations for events like World AIDS Day and Burning Man
- Participating in the [AIDS Lifecycle](https://www.aidslifecycle.org/?ref=newth.ai), cycling 545
  miles from San Francisco to Los Angeles
