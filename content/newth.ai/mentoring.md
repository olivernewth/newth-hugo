## Accelerate Your AI & Product Career

With over a decade of leadership experience at **Google**, **Meta**, **Microsoft** and **Covariant** (acquired by Amazon), I help ambitious professionals navigate the complex landscape of AI and product management.

> "The right mentor doesn't just share knowledge—they illuminate the path ahead while empowering you to forge your own journey." 

## Why Partner With a Mentor?

In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, having expert guidance can be the difference between career stagnation and exponential growth. Working with a mentor provides:

- **Strategic career navigation** informed by real-world experience
- **Technical and leadership skill development** tailored to your goals
- **Expanded professional networks** and exposure to new opportunities
- **Accelerated learning** that helps you avoid common pitfalls
- **Accountability and motivation** to pursue ambitious goals

## My Mentoring Philosophy

I believe effective mentoring balances three critical elements:

1. **Expertise sharing** - Drawing from my experiences at industry-leading companies
2. **Personal connection** - Building a relationship founded on trust and mutual respect
3. **Action orientation** - Creating concrete steps that drive measurable progress

## Areas of Expertise

My mentoring focuses on high-impact areas where I've consistently delivered results:

- **AI Product Development** - From research concepts to production systems
- **Technical Leadership** - Building and scaling high-performance teams
- **Career Advancement** - Strategic positioning for growth opportunities
- **Work-Life Integration** - Maintaining balance while pursuing excellence

## Who Benefits Most From My Mentoring

I've found I can provide the greatest value to:

- **Mid-career product managers** looking to specialize in AI products
- **Technical leaders** transitioning into product-focused roles
- **Early-stage founders** building AI-powered solutions
- **Recent graduates** seeking to establish a strong foundation in tech
