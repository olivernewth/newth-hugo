A new chapter of personal growth in my life through writing, inspired by Paul Graham's essays and
Maggie Appleton's digital garden.

This is the beginning of a new chapter for me. Until recently, I have largely written for myself,
where I have written quick notes in the hope that it helps me to remember or process something.
These thoughts get lost over time ' it's rare that I go back to old notes. I want to build something
in a way that, I hope, can be valuable to others.

So that leads me to a few questions I need to answer' What should I write about? Are there topics
which people be interested in hearing from me? What do I have to give?

### Sources of Inspiration

[Paul Graham's Essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) are one of the main sources of
inspiration as I start this new journey. Paul's essays almost always have left me with new ideas or
questions. They're not based on research but his real-world experience, and his often unique way of
looking at the world. He has one particularly interesting article called
[How to Write Usefully](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html).
{{< citation 1 "Paul Graham's 'How to Write Usefully' emphasizes that useful writing should be novel, correct, important, and strong. He argues that the combination of these factors creates writing that genuinely adds value to the reader's understanding." >}}
He considers his essays to be ones that should be useful, rather than simply being correct:

> "If you know nothing at all about an issue, you can't go wrong by saying that the issue is a
> complex one, that there are many factors to be considered, that it's a mistake to take too
> simplistic a view of it, and so on. Though no doubt correct, such statements tell the reader
> nothing. Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming
> false." â€” <cite>Paul Graham</cite>

For my writing, there are two audiences: you and me. Ideally, my writing will be useful for both of
us. I'm going to start by focusing on what could be useful for you, and to be useful it needs to be
correct and something that you likely didn't know.

I have also been inspired by [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/), who has built a
beautiful digital garden with incredibly well-written pieces ranging from AI and design to the core
concepts of knowledge building.
{{< citation 2 "Digital gardens, like Maggie Appleton's, represent a shift from traditional blogging to a more interconnected and evolving form of personal knowledge management and sharing." >}}

### Notes and Maps

For now, I'm going to structure my way of writing and this site around two main concepts: Notes and
Maps of Content ("Maps"). These notes will largely be conclusion pieces, hopefully useful pieces,
though most likely not always.

Separately, I have also begun to grow some Maps which will be continually added to, updated and
hopefully evergreen. Notes may become outdated, but the maps should never be. Over time, I want
these to grow with new insights, following techniques such as those taught by
[Nick Milo](https://www.nickmilo.com/).
{{< citation 3 "Nick Milo's 'Linking Your Thinking' methodology emphasizes the importance of creating connections between ideas to enhance understanding and creativity in personal knowledge management." >}}
I want to build maps around concepts that are either important or fascinating to me: my list so far
to build out includes (in no particular order):

1.  Thinking, or How to Think
2.  Career
3.  Goals
4.  Health
5.  Ideation
6.  AI
7.  Trends and Patterns
8.  Money

This note fails at that first goal of being useful to you, but it hopefully gives you an idea about
what is to come" and whether you might want to come back.
