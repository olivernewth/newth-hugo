Hi there! I'm Oliver, and I'm passionate about helping others level up in their tech careers. With
over a decade of experience in AI and product management at companies like Meta, Microsoft, and
Covariant, I've got a wealth of knowledge to share.

## Why Mentoring?

Look, we all need a little guidance sometimes. Mentoring is like having a secret weapon in your
career arsenal. It gives you:

- Insider tips from someone who's been there, done that
- Fresh takes on tricky situations
- A sounding board for your wild ideas (and the not-so-wild ones too)
- A foot in the door to new opportunities

## Style of Mentorship

When it comes to mentoring, here's what you can expect from me:

- A tailored approach that's all about YOU and your goals
- Straight-up, no-BS feedback (but I promise to be nice about it)
- Pushing you to think deeper and challenge yourself
- Celebrating your wins (big and small) and learning from the hiccups

## What I Bring to the Table

I've got experience in a bunch of areas, including:

- AI and machine learning product development
- Navigating the twists and turns of a tech career
- Leading teams and getting stuff done
- Juggling work and life (and not dropping too many balls)
